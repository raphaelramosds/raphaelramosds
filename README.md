## Hey fellows ðŸ‘‹

I'm Raphael and I'd like to tell you guys a little about academical and social features :grin:.

### 1. Skills :books:

All my academical carrer is sumed by coding on web projects mixing front-end and back-end side. However, I intend to follow Data Analysis' branch because how you'll remark above, I love data and how impressive is to extract information from that. 

### 2. Hobbies :brain:

I enjoy to figure out things I got questions mainly when these affairs have related to coding, economy and estatistics. Hence, I have a good time with PDFs and articles over the World Economic Forum (I literally recommend this one) and watch some videos on youtube that can distract me haha. 

### 3. A little but strong sentence :heart:

Both sentences below are into Little Prince's book (Saint ExupÃ¨ry).

> It's only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eyes

> On n'y voir bien qu'avec le coeur, l'essential est invisible pour les yeux
