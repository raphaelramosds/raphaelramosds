## Hey fellows ðŸ‘‹

I'm Raphael and I'd like to tell you guys a little about my academical and social features :grin:.

### Skills :books:

All my academical carrer is sumed by coding on web projects mixing front-end and back-end side with tecnologies like JS and PHP. However, I intend to follow Data Analysis' branch because I love data and how impressive is to extract information from that. 

My main work tools are

- Codeigniter PHP framework
- P5.js library 
- Framework 7

### A little but strong sentence :heart:

Both sentences below are into Little Prince's book (Saint ExupÃ¨ry).

> It's only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eyes

> On n'y voir bien qu'avec le coeur, l'essential est invisible pour les yeux
