### Hey fellows ðŸ‘‹

I'm Raphael and I'd like to tell you guys a little about academical and social features.

### 1. Skills

All my academical carrer is sumed by coding on web projects mixing front-end and back-end side. However, I intend to follow Data Analysis' branch because how you'll remark above, I love data and how impressive is to extract information from that. 

### 2. Hobbies

I enjoy to figure out things I got questions mainly when these affairs have related to coding, economy and estatistics. Hence, I have a good time with PDFs and articles around thw World Economic Forum (I literally recommend this one) and watch some videos on youtube that can distract me haha. 

### 3. An little but strong sentece

Both sentences below are into Little prince's book.

"It's only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eyes"

"On n'y voir bien qu'avec le coir, l'essential est invisible pour les yeux".
